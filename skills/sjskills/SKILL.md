# sjskills

Use `sjskills` to reconcile the exact skill state selected by a project's
committed `sjskills.toml` or by the tool's fixed global baseline. The tool owns
verified placement, provenance, quarantine, and restore; it does not publish
source changes or perform ad hoc catalog installs.

Strict sync covers only the selected global or project `.agents/skills` and
`.claude/skills` roots. Undeclared directories move into recoverable quarantine,
including unknown and locally modified copies. Built-in skills, plugin caches,
and legacy Pi copies are outside this boundary.

Keep four states distinct:

1. A source repository's local catalog is editable but not yet published.
2. The registry identifies the published remote content reconciliation can
   consume.
3. A project's committed `sjskills.toml` selects project profiles and direct
   declarations.
4. The registry defines one fixed, machine-independent global baseline.

Prefer `sjskills` on `PATH`. In the tool's source repository, use
`bin/sjskills` when the command is not installed. Do not install the command or
change `PATH` unless the user asks.

Use `sjskills` or `sjskills status` for a two-scope advisory report. It names the
resolved project root, offers setup guidance for a missing manifest, and reports
configuration failures without recommending replacement. It never initializes
or synchronizes. Status exits 0 even when inspection is unavailable; inspect the
findings and freshness rather than treating success as exact state. Cold checks
may take 30 seconds plus cleanup. Stale evidence remains explicitly labeled.

Explicit reports use stdout; other successful commands retain incidental stderr
notices and are silent for fresh scopes without findings.
`--json` keeps full findings in `advisories`; status also includes setup metadata
under `status`. Neither is apply authority or a substitute for a reviewed plan.
Use `--no-status-check` to skip discovery, inspection, fetching, and cache writes;
status then reports checks disabled, while other commands retain their primary
verification.

## Classify the request

- **Sync configured state:** An unqualified request to sync or reconcile with
  this skill authorizes both the fixed global baseline and the current project's
  committed `sjskills.toml`, when present. Honor an explicit project-only,
  global-only, machine, or preservation limit. If no project manifest exists,
  reconcile only the global baseline and report that the project is unconfigured;
  do not initialize it or infer profiles from installed copies.
- **Explain or inspect:** Use `status` for both scopes, `profiles` for available
  selections, or `plan` / `plan --global` for a full selected-scope review. These
  preserve managed roots but may fetch expected content temporarily. A bare
  invocation without an action defaults to status inspection.
- **Adopt a project:** Create `sjskills.toml` only when the user asks to adopt
  or initialize managed project skills. List available profiles first and use
  only profiles the user selected.
- **Reconcile a project:** Review `plan`, run `apply` only when the user asked
  to install, bootstrap, reconcile, or sync the project, then run `plan` again.
- **Recover project state:** Restore only the exact quarantine identifier the
  user named, and only after confirming every modeled destination is absent.
- **Global reconciliation or restore:** Read
  [references/global-rollout.md](references/global-rollout.md) before global
  mutation. A sync request supplies reconciliation authority; prepare and review
  the required evidence yourself instead of asking the user to approve hashes.
  Restore still requires a request identifying the quarantine.

Use the ordinary Skills CLI workflow for direct `bunx skills` discovery or
ad hoc installs. Use the repository's plugin workflow for Codex plugins. Local
catalog validation and publication are not reconciliation.

## Use configured authority

The request grants authority; the committed manifest and fixed baseline define
the desired set. Proceed with verified installs, updates, provenance migration,
and recoverable quarantine of undeclared copies within that set's managed roots.
Summarize the reviewed operations before applying, without requiring another
user turn. Use `--yes` for an already-authorized apply unless the user requests
an interactive checkpoint. A flag or plan artifact does not create authority.

"Override and sync" can override a redundant approval step; it does not resolve
unmanaged or modified desired copies, corrupt provenance, unsafe boundaries, or
failed materialization. Stop the affected scope on those conflicts and explain
the concrete resolution needed. Do not force-adopt, manually replace roots,
change profiles, or include another machine to make a plan pass. Complete an
independent unblocked scope unless the user required an all-or-nothing result.

## Project workflow

1. Resolve the command and project root. If no `sjskills.toml` exists, stop
   unless the user requested initialization.
2. For a new manifest, run `sjskills profiles`, obtain the user's profile
   choices, and run `sjskills init <profile> ...`. Do not infer profiles from
   installed copies. `init` must not overwrite an existing manifest.
3. Read the manifest and run `sjskills plan`. Summarize installs, updates,
   quarantines, unchanged placements, manual or workflow-managed entries,
   warnings, and blocks.
   Distinguish desired-state drift or conflict from a failed command, network
   request, or materialization; an operational failure is not a valid plan.
4. Stop before apply when the plan reports an unmanaged or locally modified
   desired copy, malformed or untrusted provenance, an unsafe filesystem
   boundary, an unverifiable extra, failed materialization, or another conflict.
5. For authorized project reconciliation, run `sjskills apply --yes` after the
   plan passes review. Honor any explicit request to stop at a preview or keep
   interactive confirmation.
6. Run `sjskills plan` again. Do not claim exact state while changes or blocks
   remain. Retain every reported quarantine identifier through a normal work
   cycle.

When intended content changed in a registry-backed source, reconciliation can
only consume the published remote content. Do not apply a local-only change.
If publication is requested, follow the source repository's instructions for
validation, review, commit, and publication; those mechanics are outside this
skill. Before reconciling, resolve the registry source and verify that its
pinned remote ref contains each intended skill tree. A local or feature-branch
commit is insufficient when the registry points elsewhere.

## Restore

Treat restore as a separate mutation. Require the user to name the quarantine
identifier, inspect its current state, and confirm that all destinations are
absent. Run:

```text
sjskills restore <quarantine-id>
```

Do not move, delete, or overwrite active destinations to make restore succeed.
If content or provenance changed, preserve both sides and report the conflict.
Restore does not grant ownership to unknown or locally modified copies. Run
`sjskills plan` afterward; a restored undeclared skill is again removal drift.

## Global boundary

Global reconciliation uses the fixed, machine-independent baseline. Profiles
select project skills; do not invent a global profile, infer one from the
hostname, or synthesize Pi-specific copies. An inspection request runs only
`sjskills plan --global`; configured sync continues through verified apply.

The `--approved-plan` and `--approved-plan-sha256` flags bind global apply to
the agent-reviewed evidence. Their names do not require a separate human
approval ceremony: create the artifact, inspect every operation and warning,
compute its digest, and use the same verified executable through apply and the
final plan. A sync request covers this work; an audit, repository validation,
or unrelated setup request does not. Restore and conflict resolution remain
separate from making the configured desired set exact.

## Completion

Report:

- project or fixed-global scope and whether work was read-only or mutating;
- the selected profiles or direct manifest declarations when relevant;
- plan and final-plan results, including remaining extras, blocks, and
  out-of-scope legacy state;
- published-ref evidence when remote-backed local changes were involved;
- every quarantine identifier retained or restored; and
- any mutation still awaiting explicit authority.
